                <h2>About Navigation</h2>
                <p>Navigation is coded using an unordered list because navigation is a list of web pages. As mentioned above, relative hyperlink
                 s are used when coding navigation. When you view your navigation html in a browser, you will notice that by default it is 
                 vertical and has bullets. This is because the navigation is created in an unordered list. The appearance of the navigation 
                 can be changed to be horizontal with styling, but for now we are interested in understanding how to code semantic navigation
                 with links.</p>
